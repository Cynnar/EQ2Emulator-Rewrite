1. Setup your database username/password as well as the parsing database you're using in parser-config.xml.

2. Import tables.sql to your parsing database (this should be different from your world database).

3. Your parsing database requires an opcodes table with data. Import a copy into that database.

4. Put packet logs into the SpawnLogs directory.

5. Run parse_spawns.bat to perform a parse.

6. To clear any parsed data, run the following query ON YOUR PARSING DATABASE (don't nuke your world!!!):

DELETE FROM `YOURPARSERDB`.`spawn` WHERE 1;

7. To export a parsed spawn, find your desired raw spawn in the parser's spawn table. Update the spawn ID to the desired new ID for your world.
This will update all related entries as well.

Export the rows for different spawns as follows:

spawn table for everything
